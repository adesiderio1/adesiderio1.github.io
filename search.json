For as long as I can remember, I have been drawn to data. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Statistics & Data Science at UCLA, I have applied my analytic expertise in various roles, including my time as a Data Analyst at UCLA Tennis Consulting and a Data Assistant for the City of Lancaster. My experience includes designing interactive dashboards in Tableau, conducting multivariate statistical analysis in RStudio and Python, and automating data processes using SQL. I tend to thrive in environments where I can solve complex problems and deliver impactful recommendations. With a lifelong interest in continuous learning, I am committed to leveraging data for the purpose of being able to tell a story with it.\nCareer aspirations: With an approaching graduation date around the corner (March 2025), I have numerous routes to potentially go down. But as of now one of the goals is to become a data engineer specifically within the healthcare industry. But I’m still open to the possibility of continuing my education through graduate school, as I would like to explore fields that combine my pre-existing knowledge from my undergrad degree an example being bio-statistics or epidemiology."
